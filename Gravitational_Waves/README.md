# Gravitational Wave Module

[Gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#LIGO_and_Virgo_observations) were first predicted in 1916 by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)'s Theory of [General Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity). This theory describes how space-time, the fabric of our universe, is affected by massive bodies. Imagine pulling out a giant piece of stretchy material between multiple people, and placing a heavy object in the center. The fabric warps in the middle near the large mass, causing a curvature of the fabric similar to the curvature of space-time near a massive body. The more massive the body, the more strongly the fabric of space-time is curved. 

Under certain conditions, massive objects orbiting each other will generate ripples in space-time called gravitational waves. Examples of gravitational wave producing systems are binary systems of [black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole) or [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star). [Binary systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_system) are componsed of two objects orbiting each other around a commen center of mass. As these objects orbit each other, they start to spiral in toward each other, orbiting faster and faster until they merge. The gravitational waves the in-spiral and merging events produce move outward and away from the source in a wave-like motion at the speed of light. 

Because gravitational waves warp space-time, they actually can ever-so-slightly stretch the objects they move through. Envision a flat region of space-time with a ring of particles, like pearls on a necklace, placed on it. When a gravitational wave passes through this region of space-time, the ring of particles is stretched and compressed. Gravitational waves passing through Earth actually stretch it slightly as well. These gravitational waves are physically observed by ground-based detectors called [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/about) (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and [Virgo](http://www.virgo-gw.eu/#home). These detectors have 'arms' 3-4 kilometers (1.9-2.5 miles) long with a mirror at one end and a laser at the other. The detectors can identify a change in the mirror spacing of many times smaller than the size of a [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton), a result of a passing gravitational wave.

As of December 2018, the LIGO and Virgo detectors have observed gravitational waves from [10 black hole mergers and one neutron star merger](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20181203). The neutron star merger that occurred on August 17, 2017 was a very exciting event. Unlike black hole mergers, a neutron star merger is also observable across the [electromagnetic spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum). The August 2017 neutron star merger was observed in visible light, [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_astronomy), [gamma-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_astronomy), and [X-rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_astronomy). This observation of the neutron star merger both by gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation is called [multi-messenger astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-messenger_astronomy). It is also predicted that [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino) should be produced by the neutron star merger, and subsequently detected by neutrino observatories. None were detected, although it is possible that the non-detection was the result of an outflow jet associated with the merger that was not directed toward the Earth. 

# 3D Representation of a Gravitational Wave

The first five gravitational wave detections were from black hole mergers, and the sixth was from a neutron star merger. To depict the difference among the first six gravitational wave detections, a unique method to 3D print a representation of the mergers was devised. As the gravitational wave passes a ring of particles, it distorts that ring. These rings are stacked on top of each other at each instant over a time period covering the last 1/10th of a second before the merger occurs, and a short time after the merger referred to as the ringdown. 

The gravitational wave signal received at Earth, and therefore the shape of the 3D printed representation, is determined by the masses of the objects, their orientation, and their distance from Earth. As the black holes or neutron stars get closer together, they orbit faster and faster. As a result, the gravitational wave represented as the distortion of the ring of particles gets stronger. In the 3D printed representation, you can see how the amplitude and frequency of the gravitational wave signal changes as the objects in-spiral, merge, and ringdown after the event.
