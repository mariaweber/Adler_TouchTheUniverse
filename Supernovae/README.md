# Supernovae

Supernovae (plural of supernova) are highly energetic stellar explosions. During a supernova, material is blasted away from a star at speeds approaching millions of miles per hour. They can occur in one of two ways. In the first, a star spills (or accretes) mass onto a nearby companion star until a sudden, catastrophic nuclear reaction takes place. In the second, a massive star at least 8 times greater than the Sun's mass runs out of fuel in its core and collapses against its own gravity. 

Supernovae are very rare in our Milky Way galaxy, occurring at a rate of about 3 every 100 years. However, we can also observe supernova remnants - the remainders of massive stars that underwent a supernova event in the past. Supernovae are extremely important in the grand scheme of the universe. All elements heavier than iron are made during supernova explosions. Most of the elements we find on Earth, including the materials we are made of, were formed during supernovae explosions in the early universe.    

# Cassiopeia A

Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is a supernova remnant within our Milky Way. Light from the explosion reached Earth about 300 years ago, but there are no recordings of the actual supernova event itself being observed. Cassiopeia A gets its name because it is found in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is one of the brightest [radio wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy) sources in the sky. At the center of the supernova remnant is a neutron star leftover from the core collapse of the original massive star. The progenitor (original) star had a mass between 15-25 times greater than the Sun. 

Cas A is an example of a shell-like supernova remnant. The shell of material ejected by the supernova is expaning at 9-13 million miles per hour (4,000-6,000 km/s). It has been [observed by multiple telescopes](http://heritage.stsci.edu/2006/30/supplemental.html) including the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html) in light visible with our eyes, the [Very Large Array](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/) in radio wavelengths, and by the [Chandra X-Ray Observatory](http://chandra.harvard.edu/). Together, these observations show that material from the supernova clumps into thin regions called filaments, with chains of small knots of gas. There are also jets of oppositely directed material expanding outward from the center of the explosion.   

# SN 1987A 

Supernova (SN) 1987A is a supernova whose light first reached the Earth in February 1987. It was detected in a dwarf satellite galaxy of the Milky Way called the Large Magellanic Cloud, near the [Tarantula nebula](https://astropix.ipac.caltech.edu/image/eso/eso1817b). This was the closest supernova in nearly 400 years, and provided scientists with an unprecedented opportunity. The supernova event was observed by multiple telescopes, and a burst of [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino) was independently detected at three different [neutrino observatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_detector). The progenitor star is known as a massive blue supergiant.

SN 1987A was one of Hubble Space Telescope's first observations. It showed a structure unlike any before seen from a supernova - a bright central ring surrouding the site of the progenitor star and two fainter rings, creating an hourglass-like shape. Over time, the central ring began to develop knots along it like a string of pearls. It is thought that there was a ring of gas surrounding the star late in its life. The blast wave after the supernova then collided with this ring of gas, creating the higer-density clumps of material. This ring is about one [light-year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year) across, and was [likely ejected by the star 20,000 years before the supernova](https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1030a/) event.
