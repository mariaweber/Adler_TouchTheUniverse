# Inspiring Curiosity

We are developing a pilot program at the Adler Planetarium called ‘Touch the Universe’. Our project will utilize 3D printed astrophysical objects in combination with visualizations to provide museum guests with a new way of exploring space and science concepts. It will also benefit our guests with visual impairment and those that are primarily tactile learners, providing a pathway for deeper understanding of astrophysical concepts that are often only presented visually within the planetarium experience.  

This programming will be delivered within Adler Planetarium’s Space Visualization Lab (SVL), a unique space where local astronomers and astrophysicists present their latest discoveries with breathtaking images, innovative data visualizations, and 3D video displays. Guests will be invited to touch a vast array of 3D printed items such as asteroids, nebulas, telescope replicas, representations of gravitational waves, and much more. While these objects are being investigated by the audience, SVL presenters will deliver a narrative about each item, augmented by associated telescope images, simulation visualizations, and 3D movies.  

As we establish our ‘Touch the Universe’ program, we will draw upon online resources, our many scientific collaborators both locally and around the world, and leverage Adler Planetarium’s reputation as a leader in astrophysical visualization and the use of innovative technologies within a museum environment. The 3D printable models and accompanying visualizations will either be developed in house, make use of NASA resources, or incorporate Universe of Learning source materials. To facilitate the duplication of our program by other organizations, we will make all of our materials available online via GitHub, including 3D printer files and instructions, presentation scripts, and information cards. This will ensure that those without an astronomy background can deliver the ‘Touch the Universe’ program to audiences of all ages and backgrounds at their home institutions.       

# Project Goals

Our ‘Touch the Universe’ goals are three-fold: 
* To encourage curiosity and exploration through multiple senses
* Explore new avenues to present astrophysical data via 3D printed objects
* Provide more opportunities for engagement among our guests with visual impairment

# What's Here?

Above are folders for various 'Modules', where we pair a set of visualizations with 3D printed models to tell a story about our Universe. Click on the folders, and inside you will find images, visualizations, 3D printer files, and additional documentation. Each folder has a README file, where you will find a brief overview of the module theme, links to relevant resources, and further information about what is found inside the folder. Within the README file, you will also find the credits attributed to each file. When using these resources at your institution, please cite them accordingly.  

# What's Next?

We are only just starting our 'Touch the Universe' journey. Check back on our GitHub repository and webpage for periodic updates!

# About our 3D Printer

All of the 3D printed objects we have utilized for Touch the Universe have been printed at the Adler Planetarium. Most of them were printed using
a [MakerBot Replicator+](https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/replicator/) and the free online [MakerBot Print software](https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/apps/makerbot-print/download/).
