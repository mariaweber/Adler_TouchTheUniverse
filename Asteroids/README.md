# Asteroids Module

Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun. They range in size from Ceres (587 miles in diameter) to bodies smaller than about 30 feet across. Around 1 to 2 million asteroids larger than half a mile in diameter can be found in the main asteroid belt. This belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Many of the asteroids in the main asteroid belt have been observed intensely, and maps have been made of their surfaces. 

The Earth is pelted with more than 100 tons of 'space dust' each day. About once a year, a car-sized asteroid enters the Earth's atmosphere. As it falls toward the Earth's surface, intense friction heats up the asteroid, creating a beautiful streaking fireball across the sky. Most asteroids burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, but a few land on the Earth's surface.   

We have highlighted a few unique asteroids here.

# Bennu

The asteroid Bennu, also known as 101955 Bennu or 1999 RQ36, orbits between Earth and Mars rather than in the main asteroid belt. Bennu is actually wider in the middle, taking on a roughly diamond shaped appearance. It has been suggested that its shape is due to a very rapid rotational period, spinning a complete revolution like a top every 4.3 hours. It's mean diameter is about 0.3 miles. Extremely detailed maps of Bennu show that it has boulders on its surface from a few meters in diameter up to 10-20 meters (32-66 ft).  

The asteriod Bennu is special because it was selected as the target for the [OSIRIS-REx](https://www.nasa.gov/osiris-rex) mission. This is a NASA mission to visit the near-Earth asteroid Bennu and return a sample back to Earth. The spacecraft launched in 2016, and reached Bennu in December 2018. It is currently orbiting Bennu while it surveys the asteroid for a place to land to retrieve a sample. It is expected that the mission will return the sample to Earth in 2023. 

# 'Oumuamua

['Oumuamua](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-learns-more-about-interstellar-visitor-oumuamua) is an asteroid and the first known interstellar object to enter our solar system. It was first detected in 2017 by a telescope called Pan-STARRS located on Maui, Hawaii. The name is derived from the Hawaiian word meaning 'scout'. 'Oumuamua's excess speed and path through the solar system indicate that it cannot be captured by the Sun's gravity, and so must have originated from outside our solar system. This asteroid also has a very unusual shape, approximately 5 to 10 times longer than it is wide. It tumbles through space, at times end-over-end. As a result, its observed diameter changes over time due to this tumbling motion. Its greatest observed length was reported to be over 400 meters (1,300 ft). 

# 2014 MU<sub>69</sub> a.k.a. Ultima Thule

2014 MU<sub>69</sub> is located in the Kuiper Belt. Sometimes referred to as trans-Neptunian objects, bodies in the Kuiper Belt can be found beyond the orbit of Neptune. It has been nicknamed Ultima Thule, which has both Latin and Greek origins. Its name references medieval literature, where [Ultima Thule represented places beyond known borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule). 

On January 1, 2019, the NASA spacecraft [New Horizons](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html) flew by MU<sub>69</sub> and took the best images of this object to date. It is a contact binary asteriod approximately 20 miles in diameter. Both lobes are spheroidal in shape, with the larger approximately 12 miles in diameter and the smaller about 8 miles in diameter. Both lobes have multiple indentations or pits, possibly caused by impacts or the venting of internal material. It is hypothesized that MU<sub>69</sub> was formed as the two lobes slowly spiraled closer and closer together until they touched and ultimately fused.         

# The Aquarius Project

On February 6, 2017, a meteorite approximately 3-4 ft in diameter weighing around 4,000 lbs through the Midwest sky and landed in Lake Michigan, 10 miles off the coast of Southern Wisconsin. From radar, we know approximately where it might have landed in the lake. Adler Planetarium scientists and our teen programs office thought it would be a great opportunity to get local high school students involved in designing and creating a device to retrieve fragments of the meteorite from the bottom of the lake. This is now called the Aquarius project, and you can follow their journey [here](https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/expedition/rovmeteoritehunt). The magnetic sled that the students built was successfully deployed this summer. We now have buckets of meteorite candidates that teen interns and scientists from Adler and the [Field Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/) will sort through in the coming months. 

From the [footage of the meteorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey5PA_Sn0n4&feature=youtu.be), Adler astronomer Mark Hammergren was able to calculate the trajectory of the meteorite in the sky, and backtrack its orbit through the solar system. A visualization of the asteroid's orbit made by Adler astronomers Maria Weber and Aaron Geller shows that it had a highly elliptical orbit inclined relative to the solar system plane, sweeping around the solar system once every approximately 2 years. The visualization also shows that the Aquarius Project asteroid originated within the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Over time, the gravitational pull and motion of the planets and other asteroids adjust the orbit of the asteroid such that on just the right date and time, it and the Earth are in exactly the same place.
