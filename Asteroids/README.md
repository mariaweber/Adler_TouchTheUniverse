# Asteroids Module

Asteroids are small, rocky bodies that orbit the Sun. They range in size from Vesta (329 miles in diameter) to bodies smaller than about 30 feet across. Around 1 to 2 million asteroids larger than half a mile in diameter can be found in the main asteroid belt. This belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Many of the asteroids in the main asteroid belt have been observed intensely, and maps have been made of their surfaces. 

The Earth is pelted with more than 100 tons of 'space dust' each day. About once a year, a car-sized asteroid enters the Earth's atmosphere. As it falls toward the Earth's surface, intense friction heats up the asteroid, creating a beautiful streaking fireball across the sky. Most asteroids burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, but a few land on the Earth's surface.   

# The Aquarius Project

On February 6, 2017, a meteorite the size of a minivan streaked through the Midwest sky and landed in Lake Michigan, 10 miles off the coast of Southern Wisconsin. From radar, we know approximately where it might have landed in the lake. Adler Planetarium scientists and our teen programs office thought it would be a great opportunity to get local high school students involved in designing and creating a device to retrieve fragments of the meteorite from the bottom of the lake. This is now called the Aquarius project, and you can follow their journey [here](https://openexplorer.nationalgeographic.com/expedition/rovmeteoritehunt). The magnetic sled that the students built was successfully deployed this summer. We now have buckets of meteorite candidates that teen interns and scientists from Adler and the Field Museum – Chicago’s natural history museum – will sort through in the coming months. 

From the [footage of the meteorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey5PA_Sn0n4&feature=youtu.be), Adler astronomer Mark Hammergren was able to calculate the trajectory of the meteorite in the sky, and backtrack its orbit through the solar system. A visualization of the asteroid's orbit made by Adler astronomers Maria Weber and Aaron Geller shows that it had a highly elliptical orbit inclined relative to the solar system plane, sweeping around the solar system once every approximately 2 years. The visualization also shows that the Aquarius Project asteroid originated within the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Over time, the gravitational pull and motion of the planets and other asteroids adjust the orbit of the asteroid such that on just the right date and time, it and the Earth are in exactly the same place.
