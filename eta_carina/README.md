# Eta Carinae and the Homunculus Nebula

Eta Carinae is a stellar system located in the constellation of Carina in the Southern Hemisphere. It is composed of two massive stars in a binary orbit, located at a distance of about 7,500 light-years from Earth. The largest star Eta Carina A is 100-200 times more massive than the Sun, while Eta Carina B is smaller at 30-80 solar masses. These two stars orbit each other with a period of of 5.5 years. The orbit is highly eccentric, meaning the stars orbit around the center of mass of the system in an elongated oval rather than a circle.

During the time period between 1837-1855, Eta Carinae experienced an event referred to as the Great Eruption. During the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae had large fluctuations in brightness, and at one point was the second brightest star in the night sky. During the Great Eruption, at least 10-40 solar masses worth of material was ejected, resulting in the formation of the surrounding Homunculus Nebula (meaning 'little man' in Latin). This cloud of gas and dust constinues to expand at more than 1.3 million miles per hour. Amazingly, both stars survived the explosion. Although, it is expected that Eta Carina A may experience a supernova in the near future (astronomically speaking). 

The Homunculus Nebula is known for its unusual shape and structure. It consists of two lobes that take the shape of a dumbbell, with a length of around 1 light-year between the ends of each lobe. These lobes are actually thin shells of material (mostly hollow in the middle), with either polar holes or deep indentations at the end of each lobe. There are also spiral shaped 'trenches' at the end of each lobe, and a thin skirt of material near the middle of the nebula at the intersection between the two lobes. These features are seen well in composite ultraviolet and visible light images. The exact processes that led to the shape of the Homunculus Nebula are still being explored by scientists with the help of computer simulations.

Many stars have something called a stellar wind, which is a stream of particles flowing outward from their surfaces. The two massive stars that make up Eta Carinae also have powerful stellar winds. These winds spiral around the stars and collide violently with each other producing shock waves. [Simulations of these winds](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/449/4/3780/1167282) have been converted into 3D printed models. In the 3D printed models of the stellar winds from Eta Carinae included here, the wind from Eta Carina A is the printed surface, while the wind from Eta Carina B is the cavity that remains.  

With 3D printing, scientists can now examine the results of their simulations and observations in the palm of their hands.

[NuSTAR](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/main/index.html) is a spaceborne telescope that observes light at X-ray wavelengths. Cosmic rays are high energy particles ejected from some of the most highly energetic objects in our universe.
