# Parker Solar Probe Module

Our Sun is a magnetic star. Its magnetism has an impact on Earth's habitability and our increasingly technological world. Yet, thereis still much we do not understand about our own star. For example, there are still many processess that occur in its outermost atmosphere, called the corona, that puzzle solar scientists.

On August 12, 2018, NASA successfully launched the Parker Solar Probe. See its current location within the solar system at this [link](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Where-Is-PSP). This spacecraft will travel seven times closer to the Sun than any other previous spacecraft mission. The Parker Solar Probe is named for solar physicist Dr. Eugene Parker, an emeritus professor at the University of Chicago, who developed many theories relevant to the study of the Sun and astrophysics as a whole.

Over the course of seven years, the Parker Probe will get within nine times the Sun's radius from the surface. During this time, it will take many measurements to learn about the flow of energy from the Sun's surface, the nature of the Sun's magnetic field in the corona, and how enegetic particles are accelerated within this region.

For this module, we pair many visualizations created by NASA/Johns Hopkins APL of the Parker Probe's launch, operation, and journey through the solar system with a 3D model of the spacecraft created by Adler Planetarium volunteer Elizabeth Koprucki. The model has been made to scale from the specs listed on the NASA Parker Probe website. The model features the spacecraft in the mode when its solar panels are folded in, protected from the Sun's intense energy by the heat shield on the front of the spacecraft.     

# Watch this Space!

We will include more information about the Parker Solar Probe mission soon. Also visit the [Parker Solar Probe Website](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/index.php#the-mission). More information about the 3D printing process for the 3D model, including a timelapse video of the printing process, will also be coming soon.
