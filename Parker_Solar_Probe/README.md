# Parker Solar Probe Module

Our Sun is a magnetic star. Its magnetism has an impact on Earth's habitability and our increasingly technological world. Yet, there is still much we do not understand about our own star. For example, there are still many processess that occur in its outermost atmosphere, called the [corona](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/corona.shtml), that puzzle solar scientists.

On August 12, 2018, NASA successfully launched the [Parker Solar Probe](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/index.php#the-mission). See its current location within the solar system at this [link](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Where-Is-PSP). This spacecraft will travel seven times closer to the Sun than any other previous spacecraft mission. The Parker Solar Probe is named for solar physicist [Dr. Eugene Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Parker), an emeritus professor at the University of Chicago, who developed many theories relevant to the study of the Sun and astrophysics as a whole.

Over the course of seven years, the Parker Probe will get within nine times the Sun's radius from the surface (about 3.8 million miles). Upon its closest approaches in 2024-2025, it will temporarily be the fastest humanmade object, travelling at speeds of near 125 miles per second. In order to get this close to the Sun, the Parker Probe will fly by Venus seven times to help alter its trajectory. After 24 orbits around the Sun, it is expected that the Parker Solar Probe will eventually burn up and plunge into the Sun. 

During the Parker Probe's mission, it will take many measurements with its [suite of instruments](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/Spacecraft/index.php#Instruments) to learn about the flow of energy from the Sun's surface, the nature of the Sun's magnetic field in the corona, and how enegetic particles are accelerated within this region. For example, the Parker Probe will send back data to help scientists understand why parts of the corona can reach temperatures 300 times higher than the solar surface. It will help us understand the processes that occur in the corona which result in extreme eruptions of magnetized material called solar storms. These solar storms occasionally impact the Earth, posing a threat to Earth-orbiting satellites and our electrical power grid. And finally, it will monitor the [solar wind](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml), a stream of charged particles flowing outward through the Sun which fills the entire solar system. 

Rather than taking images of the entire Sun, the Parker Probe will take images of just the corona and the solar material flowing past the spacecraft. An early [image from the Parker Probe in Novemeber 2018](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/preparing-for-discovery-with-nasas-parker-solar-probe) depicts a coronal streamer. These are elongated, pointed loops of magnetic field which are attached to the Sun's surface. Material
within the corona is attracted to these magnetic fields, mapping out the shape of the coronal streamer magnetic field.

For this module, we pair [visualizations](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Animations.php#Animations) created by NASA/Johns Hopkins APL of the Parker Probe with a 3D model of the spacecraft. The model has been made to scale from the [specs](http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/index.php#spacecraft) listed on the NASA Parker Probe website. The model features the spacecraft in the mode where its solar panels are folded in, protected from the Sun's intense energy by the carbon-composite heat shield on the front of the spacecraft.
