# Solar Magnetic Fields - The Solar Cycle, Corona, and Wind

Our Sun has an internal magnetic furnace. It generates all of this magnetism deep in its interior through motion of the hot, churning, conductive gas of which it is made. Bundles of this magnetism then rise to the Sun's surface, forming dark regions of intense magnetic fields called [sunspots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot). Typical sunpspots are about the size of Earth, but some can be [as large as Jupiter](http://www.thesuntoday.org/solar-observations/ar12192-the-largest-sunspot-group-of-solar-cycle-24/)! Often these magnetic ropes continue to rise above the sunspot regions and are visible as giant arches of magnetism attached to the Sun's surface. Hot gas from the Sun's atmosphere is attracted to these loops of magnetism, mapping out [glowing magnetic arches](https://www.nasa.gov/content/coronal-loops-in-an-active-region-of-the-sun) that extend thousands of kilometers above its surface.

The process that generates the Sun's magnetism is called a dynamo. Dynamos convert mechanical energy (i.e. rotation and motion of the Sun's hot gas) into magnetic energy. Much like the Earth's magnetic field, the Sun's global (i.e. overall) magnetic field is at times similar to that of a bar magnet. We refer to this as a dipolar magnetic field, having a North and South magnetic pole at the North and South geographical poles. Approximately every 11 years, the Sun flips the orientation of its magnetic poles. 

The Sun's 11 year cycle of magnetism, referred to as the solar cycle, is also [tracked by the number of sunspots](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SunspotCycle.shtml) that appear on the Sun's surface.The time period corresponding to the greatest number of sunspots is called solar maximum. Solar minimum occurs during times of little to no sunspots. During the solar cycle, [the shape of the global magnetic fields](https://scied.ucar.edu/sun-corona-solar-min-max) in the Sun's outermost atmosphere, called the corona, also changes. The corona is very thin and faint. It can only be viewed during total solar eclipses ([like the one the United States experienced in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017)) or with special telescopes called [coronagraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronagraph), which block the light coming from the Sun's central disk. Hot gas from the Sun's outer atmosphere is attracted to the magnetic fields extended above the Sun's surface, tracing out the Sun's large-scale magnetic field. 

During solar minimum, the shape of the corona is quite simple. It has 'closed' magnetic loops mostly confined to the Sun's low latitudes, some of which extend many times the Sun's radius into space. At the poles are so-called 'open' magnetic fields, where the magnetic field lines are attached to the Sun's surface and extend outward and away from the Sun. Along these open magnetic field lines, material from the Sun flows outward at speeds of up to 1.5 million miles per hour. This stream of material is called the [solar wind](https://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SolarWind.shtml). There is also a 'slower' solar wind of up to 900,000 miles per hour in the lower latitude region of closed magnetic fields. The regions of open magnetic fields are often referred to as [coronal holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_hole). They are not visible in solar observations, as these regions are less dense compared to the material trapped along the closed magnetic loops. 

# Models of Stellar Magnetic Fields

A represenation of a simple magnetic field structure during solar minimum is depicted by the 'slow rotator' 3D printed magnetic field model. In this model, the small sphere in the center is the Sun, and the magnetic field lines extend outward to 10 times the Sun's radius. Near the equator, there are elongated coronal streamers (sometimes called [helmet streamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet_streamer)). These are loops of closed magnetic field lines that have been stretched to pointy tips by the solar wind. These streamers are readily observed during solar eclipses or with coronagraph telescopes. Their number and complexity changes during the 11 year solar cycle. The open magnetic field lines near the poles are regions where the solar wind rushes outward, flowing along these magnetic field lines that extend to the edge of the solar system. Typically open magnetic field lines are not observed during eclipses or with coronagraphs.

The August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse visible across the United States occured during solar minimum. As such, the shape of the corona seen by more than 200 million Americans was quite simple, with mostly low latitude coronal streamers. A team of scientists created a magnetic model to predict the shape of the August 2017 corona, and actually [got very close to what was observed](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/how-scientists-predicted-corona-s-appearance-during-aug-21-2017-total-solar-eclipse). During a period of stronger magnetic activity, the total solar eclipse visible from Australia on November 13, 2012 showed a [corona with streamers appearing at all latitudes](http://www.zam.fme.vutbr.cz/~druck/Eclipse/Ecl2012a/0-info.htm), even the solar poles. This one was truly crown-like, after all, corona is Latin for 'crown'.     

Our Sun has a rotation period of about one month. That's pretty slow compared to most other solar-like stars in our galaxy. When our Sun was younger, it also rotated faster. As stars rotate, their large-scale magnetic field twists into a spiral. This effect is very noticeable in the 'rapid rotator' model of the 3D printed stellar magnetic field. In this model, this star is spinning 10 times more rapidly than the Sun. If you look at the model from the top, you can clearly see the pinwheel shape of the magnetic field due to rotation. 

# Further Reading

Read more from the scientists themselves about how they used supercomputers to predict the shape of the corona during the August 2017 solar eclipse [here](http://www.predsci.com/corona/aug2017eclipse/home.php). The results of that simulation appears in our repository.

Scientists can also take magnetic maps of the Sun's surface and use those to draw what the Sun's magnetic lines of force might look like, both the 'open' and 'closed' magnetic fields discussed above. One example of a magnetic model that illustrates this is discussed [here](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4391), and is also found in this repository.

Stellar magnetic field model 'slow rotator': SlowRotator.stl <br/>
CREDIT: Adam Finley, University of Exeter <br/>
NOTES: After many iterations, we found the best way to print this object is to print it with 100% infill density, include supports, and change the support angle to 30 degrees. Previously, parts of the print were collapsing because they were not supported. Decreasing the support angle adds support to parts printed at a shallower angle (a value of zero puts supports everywhere, a value of 90 includes no supports). This print also required very careful removal of the supports, and is quite fragile. If you need to reattach parts that have fallen off, we suggest a two-part epoxy. Most superglues do not bond to 3D printer material. A 10 cm tall version of this object (enlarged 500%) took approximately 5 hours to print.

NOTES: As with the slow rotator, the best way to print this object is with 100% infill density, include supports, and a support angle of 30 degrees. Use care when removing the supports. A 10 cm tall version (enlarged 500%) took approximately 9 hours to print.
